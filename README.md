# Hurdles-Game-In-Python

In this never-ending motorcycle racing game, your goal is to help the rider avoid obstacles, mainly cars that block the way. You need quick reflexes to jump over these cars, allowing the rider to keep going and score big. To do this, you just need to be good with the keyboard or spacebar for control. The faster you react, the longer the rider stays in the game.
